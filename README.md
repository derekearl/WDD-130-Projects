This is the Web Fundamentals (WDD 130) class at BYU-I learning and applying HTML and CSS.
The first few weeks are spent learning new HTML and CSS code and using it to build a fictional 
rafting business and the last couple of weeks is using that basic knowledge and apply it to make
our own website of what we want.
